## Technical Stuff


### Code Coverage

Every single line of code has been tested with unit tests and widget tests. Here's the test coverage report:

<img src="docs/code-coverage.png" />

You can verify the test coverage by running the following command:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

and navigating to the generated `/coverage` directory.

### Pagination

There are two types of pagination implemented in the project:

1. **Infinite Scroll Pagination**: The absence list is paginated with infinite scroll. When the user reaches the end of the list, the next page is loaded automatically. This pagination will show up in mobile devices.
  
2. **Manual Pagination**: The user can manually change the page number from the settings page. This pagination will show up in desktop devices.

### Linting

The codebase goes through a very strict linting process. You can find all the custom linting rules in the [analysis_options.yaml](analysis_options.yaml) file.


### Documentation

All the public functions, classes, variables, and enums are documented with Dartdoc. 

### CI/CD

The project is set up with Github Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in the [.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yaml) file.
